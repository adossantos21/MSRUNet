%% Semantic Segmentation of Multispectral Images Using Deep Learning
% This example shows how to perform semantic segmentation of a multispectral 
% image with seven channels using a U-Net.
% 
% Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class. 
% One application of semantic segmentation is tracking deforestation, which is 
% the change in forest cover over time. Environmental agencies track deforestation 
% to assess and quantify the environmental and ecological health of a region.
% 
% Deep learning based semantic segmentation can yield a precise measurement 
% of vegetation cover from high-resolution aerial photographs. One challenge is 
% differentiating classes with similar visual characteristics, such as trying 
% to classify a green pixel as grass, shrubbery, or tree. To increase classification 
% accuracy, some data sets contain multispectral images that provide additional 
% information about each pixel. For example, the Hamlin Beach State Park data 
% set supplements the color images with three near-infrared channels that provide 
% a clearer separation of the classes.
% 
% 
% 
% This example shows how to use deep learning semantic segmentation techniques 
% to calculate the percentage vegetation cover in a region from a set of multispectral 
% images.
%% Download Data
% This example uses a high-resolution multispectral data set to train the network 
% [1]. The image set was captured using a drone over the Hamlin Beach State Park, 
% NY. The data contains labeled training, validation, and test sets, with 18 object 
% class labels. The size of the data file is 3.0 GB.
% 
% Download the MAT-file version of the data set using the |downloadHamlinBeachMSIData| 
% helper function. This function is attached to the example as a supporting file. 
% Specify |dataDir| as the desired location of the data.

dataDir = fullfile(tempdir,"rit18_data"); 
downloadHamlinBeachMSIData(dataDir);
%% Inspect Training Data
% Load the data set into the workspace.
load rit18_data.mat
%% 
% Examine the structure of the data.

%% 
% The multispectral image data is arranged as _numChannels_-by-_width_-by-_height_ 
% arrays. However, in MATLAB®, multichannel images are arranged as _width_-by-_height_-by-_numChannels_ 
% arrays. To reshape the data so that the channels are in the third dimension, 
% use the |switchChannelsToThirdPlane| helper function. This function is attached 
% to the example as a supporting file.

train_data = switchChannelsToThirdPlane(train_data);
val_data   = switchChannelsToThirdPlane(val_data);
test_data  = switchChannelsToThirdPlane(test_data);

%% Create Random Patch Extraction Datastore for Training
% Use a random patch extraction datastore to feed the training data to the network. 
% This datastore extracts multiple corresponding random patches from an image 
% datastore and pixel label datastore that contain ground truth images and pixel 
% label data. Patching is a common technique to prevent running out of memory 
% for large images and to effectively increase the amount of available training 
% data.
% 
% Begin by storing the training images from "|train_data.mat"| in an <docid:matlab_ref#butueui-1 
% |imageDatastore|>. Because the MAT file format is a nonstandard image format, 
% you must use a MAT file reader to enable reading the image data. You can use 
% the helper MAT file reader, |matRead6Channels|, that extracts the first six 
% channels from the training data and omits the last channel containing the mask. 
% This function is attached to the example as a supporting file.

imds = imageDatastore("train_data.mat",FileExtensions=".mat",ReadFcn=@matRead6Channels);
%% 
% Create a <docid:vision_ref#mw_c2246553-ba4a-4bad-aad4-6ab8fa2f7f2d |pixelLabelDatastore|> 
% to store the label patches containing the 18 labeled regions.

pixelLabelIds = 1:18;
pxds = pixelLabelDatastore("train_labels.png",classNames,pixelLabelIds);
%% 
% Create a <docid:images_ref#mw_19a16ac8-a068-411c-8f32-def517a4399a |randomPatchExtractionDatastore|> 
% from the image datastore and the pixel label datastore. Each mini-batch contains 
% 16 patches of size 256-by-256 pixels. One thousand mini-batches are extracted 
% at each iteration of the epoch.

dsTrain = randomPatchExtractionDatastore(imds,pxds,[256,256],PatchesPerImage=16000);
%% 
% The random patch extraction datastore |dsTrain| provides mini-batches of data 
% to the network at each iteration of the epoch. Preview the datastore to explore 
% the data.

inputBatch = preview(dsTrain);

%% Create U-Net Network Layers
% This example uses a variation of the U-Net network. In U-Net, the initial 
% series of convolutional layers are interspersed with max pooling layers, successively 
% decreasing the resolution of the input image. These layers are followed by a 
% series of convolutional layers interspersed with upsampling operators, successively 
% increasing the resolution of the input image [2]. The name U-Net comes from 
% the fact that the network can be drawn with a symmetric shape like the letter 
% U.
% 
% This example modifies the U-Net to use zero-padding in the convolutions, so 
% that the input and the output to the convolutions have the same size. Use the 
% helper function, |createUnet|, to create a U-Net with a few preselected hyperparameters. 
% This function is attached to the example as a supporting file.

inputTileSize = [256,256,6];

%% Select Training Options
% Train the network using stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM) optimization. 
% Specify the hyperparameter settings for SGDM by using the <docid:nnet_ref#bu59f0q 
% |trainingOptions|> function.
% 
% Training a deep network is time-consuming. Accelerate the training by specifying 
% a high learning rate. However, this can cause the gradients of the network to 
% explode or grow uncontrollably, preventing the network from training successfully. 
% To keep the gradients in a meaningful range, enable gradient clipping by specifying 
% "|GradientThreshold"| as |0.05|, and specify "|GradientThresholdMethod"| to 
% use the L2-norm of the gradients.

initialLearningRate = 0.05;
maxEpochs = 150;

%% Train the Network or Download Pretrained Network
% By default, the example downloads a pretrained version of U-Net for this dataset 
% using the |downloadTrainedUnet| helper function. This function is attached to 
% the example as a supporting file. The pretrained network enables you to run 
% the entire example without having to wait for training to complete.
% 
% To train the network, set the |doTraining| variable in the following code 
% to |true|. Train the model by using the <docid:nnet_ref#bu6sn4c |trainNetwork|> 
% function.
% 
% Train on a GPU if one is available. Using a GPU requires Parallel Computing 
% Toolbox and a CUDA® enabled NVIDIA® GPU. For more information, see <docid:distcomp_ug#mw_57e04559-0b60-42d5-ad55-e77ec5f5865f 
% GPU Support by Release>. Training takes about 20 hours on an NVIDIA Titan X.

% You can now use the U-Net to semantically segment the multispectral image.
%% Perform Semantic Segmentation
% The example evaluates the network using the validation image because the data 
% set includes ground truth labels for the validation image but not the test image.
% 
% To perform the forward pass on the trained network, use the |segmentMultispectralImage| 
% helper function with the test data set. This function is attached to the example 
% as a supporting file. The |segmentMultispectralImage| function performs segmentation 
% on image patches using the <docid:vision_ref.mw_bbecb1af-a6c9-43d1-91f5-48607edc15d1 
% |semanticseg|> function.

predictPatchSize = [1024 1024];
segmentedImage = segmentMultispectralImage(val_data,net,predictPatchSize);
%% 
% To extract only the valid portion of the segmentation, multiply the segmented 
% image by the mask channel of the validation data.

%% Quantify Segmentation Accuracy
% Create a <docid:vision_ref#mw_c2246553-ba4a-4bad-aad4-6ab8fa2f7f2d |pixelLabelDatastore|>

%% Calculate Extent of Vegetation Cover
% The final goal of this example is to calculate the extent of vegetation cover 
% in the multispectral image. 
% 
% Find the number of pixels labeled vegetation. The label IDs 2 ("Trees"), 13 
% ("LowLevelVegetation"), and 14 ("Grass_Lawn") are the vegetation classes. Also 
% find the total number of valid pixels by summing the pixels in the ROI of the 
% mask image.

vegetationClassIds = uint8([2,13,14]);
vegetationPixels = ismember(segmentedImage(:),vegetationClassIds);
validPixels = (segmentedImage~=0);

numVegetationPixels = sum(vegetationPixels(:));
numValidPixels = sum(validPixels(:));
%% 
% Calculate the percentage of vegetation cover by dividing the number of vegetation 
% pixels by the number of valid pixels.

percentVegetationCover = (numVegetationPixels/numValidPixels)*100;
fprintf("The percentage of vegetation cover is %3.2f%%.",percentVegetationCover);
